# ANTH-641_Week-4
This repository holds files and instructions for Week 4 exercises. 

__Note:__ This repo also held an activity on relational databases using a Microsoft Access database, but it was removed as a courtesy to the archaeologist to whom the database belongs. However, I recommend desgining an introductory database activity for students who have limited experience with desgining and querying a database.
